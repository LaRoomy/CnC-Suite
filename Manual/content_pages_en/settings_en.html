            <h4>General Settings</h4>
            <p>
                Basic settings such as language and design can be defined here,
                as well as the behavior at program start and whether a history of the processed files should be created.
                If the language is adjusted, the application must be restarted so that the required resources can be reloaded.
                There are 3 options available for the design selection: light, medium and dark (light grey/dark grey/black).

            </p>
            <img class="appImages" src="../img_content_pages/settings_general_page.png"/>
            <p>
                With the app launch behavior it can be specified whether the expanded program paths should be restored in the tree view,
                whether the last tabs and their content should be reloaded and whether the content of tabs that were not saved should be restored.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="separatorDiv"></div>
            <h4>Tab-Control Settings</h4>
            <p>
                The behavior of the tabs can be adjusted here. If autosave is active, then (if a path has been specified) the tab content will be saved every 15 seconds.
                If a file is always opened in a new tab, the current tab can be prevented from being overwritten. If the current tab has not been saved,
                confirmation is still required. Unsaved content will not be overwritten. 
                If the document properties are not used, you can specify here that the property window is initially hidden on startup.
            </p>
            <img class="appImages" src="../img_content_pages/settings_tabcontrol.png"/>
            <p>
                The descriptors of the document-properties are customizable. Other values could be entered here. 
                If a general template is set, here is defined whether it is inserted or not. At last the line-end formatting for 
                the export-function can be selected.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="separatorDiv"></div>
            <h4>Explorer Settings</h4>
            <p>
                When a file is opened with the open-button of the main toolbar, here can be set whether the path to the file 
                is expanded in the explorer tree-view. This will only work if the path is inside of the root folder path. 
                If a new file is created using the explorer, here it can be set that the file is directly opened in a new tab. 
                The third checkbox determines if the document-properties are shown as tooltip or not (on mouse hover).
            </p>
            <img class="appImages" src="../img_content_pages/settings_file_explorer.png"/>
            <p>
                Moreover the behavior of the search-window could be adjusted here and the elements to be searched for can be selected.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div class="separatorDiv"></div>
            <h4>Other Settings</h4>
            <p>
                All other settings pages are described in the appropriate section about the issue in this manual.
